# The Deep forest
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ikiKlZjWb9Y?si=GyVeMC4Z1ybsIdcC>
### Overview:
This is **"The Deep Forest"**, a project created by me, Tim B       ([**mercygoat**](https://github.com/mercygoat)) with help from my sister Yasmin B ([**@yaskadraws**](https://www.instagram.com/yaskadraws/)) 
### How to run:
The folder includes a file called "thedeepforest.zip" where you can find "game.exe".
### The game:
The game begins with a little girl being lost in the woods, and her only chance of escaping this strange "dream" is finding five pages that are spread across those woods. However, there is a weird, unearthly creature (often reffered to as "The Entity") that is trying to catch her for an unknown reason.

***Can you escape?***
### How it was done:
The code was written with LOVE2D using Lua. Libraries that I used are Windfield for physics and colliders, Camera for camerawork, STI(Simple Tiled Implementation) for map layout, and Anim8 for, well, animations. Sounds are taken from Slender: The Eight Pages, and the music box song is from [this video](https://youtu.be/0ewQiU3q5jM?si=8HlMaaOIa9--4NEC)

### Difficulties during the project:
I was having a lot of difficulties with this project (as with everything in CS50), but for most things I found a solution or at least a workaround. The only problem that I haven't solved completely is making it so that the main character's and the Entity's speed were consistent across different systems. Oh, and also adding randomness into the game, but I'm sure if I had had more time, I would have implemented those two features into the game too.
