# The Deep forest
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ikiKlZjWb9Y?si=GyVeMC4Z1ybsIdcC>
### Overview:
This is **"The Deep Forest"**, a project created by me, Tim B       ([**mercygoat**](https://github.com/mercygoat)) with help from my sister Yasmin B ([**@yaskadraws**](https://www.instagram.com/yaskadraws/)) 
### How to run:
The folder includes a file called "thedeepforest.zip" where you can find "game.exe".
### The game:
The game begins with a little girl being lost in the woods, and her only chance of escaping this strange "dream" is finding five pages that are spread across those woods. However, there is a weird, unearthly creature (often reffered to as "The Entity") that is trying to catch her for an unknown reason.

***Can you escape?***
### How to play:
The game's objective is collecting five pages.

Movement:\
"W" or "↑" to go up\
"A" or "←" to go left\
"S" or "↓" to go down\
"D" or "→" to go right\
"Left Shift" to sprint
### How it was done:
The code was written with LOVE2D using Lua. Libraries that I used are Windfield for physics and colliders, Camera for camerawork, STI(Simple Tiled Implementation) for map layout, and Anim8 for, well, animations. Sounds are taken from Slender: The Eight Pages, and the music box song is from [this video](https://youtu.be/0ewQiU3q5jM?si=8HlMaaOIa9--4NEC)

### Biggest inspirations:
The biggest inspirations for this game were probably 
#### Slender: The Eight Pages

and
#### The Beast from Over the Garden Wall

### Difficulties during the project:
I was having a lot of difficulties with this project (as with everything in CS50,) but for most things I found a solution or at least a workaround. The only problem that I haven't solved completely is making it so that the main character's and the Entity's speed were consistent across different systems. Oh, and also adding randomness into the game, but I'm sure if I had had more time, I would have implemented those two features into the game too.
### Personal Growth (Thoughts):
Three weeks ago, I was very hesitant to start the project, because of how massive it seemed from the beginning. The only reason I started doing it is that I was *really* bored with my life. But as I progressed further into the development of this project, I began noticing new ideas that I didn't have at the start. Things like adding a sprite like this or adding a sound of that. Because I became so invested into it, it started feeling more and more fulfilling. This will probably sound cheesy, but this little "game" became a part of me. And yeah, I'm not going to lie, I was encountering problems every five minutes, but it was all worth it in the end.
### Sources:
I won't link much because there are simply way too many on the web, however there are three resources that I'd like to highlight, and those three are: [Challacade's Love2D Basics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqPLyUreLV8DrLcLvQQ64Uz_h_JGLgGg2&si=qKXV5fGgVkgGHyKU), [Love2D's forums](https://love2d.org/forums/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/love2d/)
### CS50:
Just like the final project, this course played a great role in shaping me into who I am today. Thank you David. J Malan and other staff for creating and developing the wonderful experience that is CS50!
